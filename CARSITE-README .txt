General Summary:
A assembled_cpu auction site using JSP (while running on an Apache Tomcat Server) which displays a proper interface to a user who must initially create an account and log in. Once logged in, multiple actions can be taken by the user. A user can create their own auction, search through all current auctions in the database, bid on any one of those auctions, set up an automatic bidding setting, and much more. Additionally, there are preset Administrator and Customer Rep. accounts which have the ability to take part in
more managerial functionalities.


EVERYTHING is stored in a mySQL database. The .sql file is attached and includes the entire schema of the database. 




The following videos below display the use of each of the primary
functionalities of the site.
